-- | Accelerate backend generating LLVM
--   
--   This library implements a backend for the <i>Accelerate</i> language
--   which generates LLVM-IR targeting CUDA capable GPUs. For further
--   information, refer to the main <i>Accelerate</i> package:
--   <a>http://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate</a>

data LLVM target a :: * -> * -> *

-- | The PTX execution target for NVIDIA GPUs.
--   
--   The execution target carries state specific for the current execution
--   context. The data here --- device memory and execution streams --- are
--   implicitly tied to this CUDA execution context.
--   
--   Don't store anything here that is independent of the context, for
--   example state related to [persistent] kernel caching should _not_ go
--   here.
data PTX

-- | Lift a computation from the <a>IO</a> monad.

-- | Copy an array from the remote device to the host. Although the
--   Accelerate program is hyper-strict and will evaluate the computation
--   as soon as any part of it is demanded, the individual array payloads
--   are copied back to the host _only_ as they are demanded by the Haskell
--   program. This has several consequences:
--   
--   <ol>
--   <li>If the device has multiple memcpy engines, only one will be used.
--   The transfers are however associated with a non-default stream.</li>
--   <li>Using <a>seq</a> to force an Array to head-normal form will
--   initiate the computation, but not transfer the results back to the
--   host. Requesting an array element or using <tt>deepseq</tt> to force
--   to normal form is required to actually transfer the data.</li>
--   </ol>

-- | This module implements a backend for the <i>Accelerate</i> language
--   targeting NVPTX for execution on NVIDIA GPUs. Expressions are on-line
--   translated into LLVM code, which is just-in-time executed in parallel
--   on the GPU.
module Data.Array.Accelerate.LLVM.PTX

-- | Accelerate is an <i>embedded language</i> that distinguishes between
--   vanilla arrays (e.g. in Haskell memory on the CPU) and embedded arrays
--   (e.g. in device memory on a GPU), as well as the computations on both
--   of these. Since Accelerate is an embedded language, programs written
--   in Accelerate are not compiled by the Haskell compiler (GHC). Rather,
--   each Accelerate backend is a <i>runtime compiler</i> which generates
--   and executes parallel SIMD code of the target language at application
--   <i>runtime</i>.
--   
--   The type constructor <a>Acc</a> represents embedded collective array
--   operations. A term of type <tt>Acc a</tt> is an Accelerate program
--   which, once executed, will produce a value of type <tt>a</tt> (an
--   <a>Array</a> or a tuple of <a>Arrays</a>). Collective operations of
--   type <tt>Acc a</tt> comprise many <i>scalar expressions</i>, wrapped
--   in type constructor <a>Exp</a>, which will be executed in parallel.
--   Although collective operations comprise many scalar operations
--   executed in parallel, scalar operations <i>cannot</i> initiate new
--   collective operations: this stratification between scalar operations
--   in <a>Exp</a> and array operations in <a>Acc</a> helps statically
--   exclude <i>nested data parallelism</i>, which is difficult to execute
--   efficiently on constrained hardware such as GPUs.
--   
--   For example, to compute a vector dot product we could write:
--   
--   <pre>
--   dotp :: Num a =&gt; Vector a -&gt; Vector a -&gt; Acc (Scalar a)
--   dotp xs ys =
--     let
--         xs' = use xs
--         ys' = use ys
--     in
--     fold (+) 0 ( zipWith (*) xs' ys' )
--   </pre>
--   
--   The function <tt>dotp</tt> consumes two one-dimensional arrays
--   (<a>Vector</a>s) of values, and produces a single (<a>Scalar</a>)
--   result as output. As the return type is wrapped in the type
--   <a>Acc</a>, we see that it is an embedded Accelerate computation - it
--   will be evaluated in the <i>object</i> language of dynamically
--   generated parallel code, rather than the <i>meta</i> language of
--   vanilla Haskell.
--   
--   As the arguments to <tt>dotp</tt> are plain Haskell arrays, to make
--   these available to Accelerate computations they must be embedded with
--   the <a>use</a> function.
--   
--   An Accelerate backend is used to evaluate the embedded computation and
--   return the result back to vanilla Haskell. Calling the <tt>run</tt>
--   function of a backend will generate code for the target architecture,
--   compile, and execute it. For example, the following backends are
--   available:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><a>accelerate-llvm-native</a>: for execution on multicore
--   CPUs</li>
--   <li><a>accelerate-llvm-ptx</a>: for execution on NVIDIA CUDA-capable
--   GPUs</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   See also <a>Exp</a>, which encapsulates embedded _scalar_
--   computations.
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><i><i>Tips:</i></i></li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>Since <a>Acc</a> represents embedded computations that will only
--   be executed when evaluated by a backend, we can programatically
--   generate these computations using the meta language Haskell; for
--   example, unrolling loops or embedding input values into the generated
--   code.</li>
--   <li>It is usually best to keep all intermediate computations in
--   <a>Acc</a>, and only <tt>run</tt> the computation at the very end to
--   produce the final result. This enables optimisations between
--   intermediate results (e.g. array fusion) and, if the target
--   architecture has a separate memory space as is the case of GPUs, to
--   prevent excessive data transfers.</li>
--   </ul>
data Acc a :: * -> *

-- | <a>Arrays</a> consists of nested tuples of individual <a>Array</a>s,
--   currently up to 15-elements wide. Accelerate computations can thereby
--   return multiple results.
class (Typeable * a, Typeable * (ArrRepr a)) => Arrays a

-- | Compile and run a complete embedded array program.
--   
--   Note that it is recommended that you use <a>run1</a> whenever
--   possible.
run :: Arrays a => Acc a -> a

-- | As <a>run</a>, but execute using the specified target rather than
--   using the default, automatically selected device.
--   
--   Contexts passed to this function may all target to the same device, or
--   to separate devices of differing compute capabilities.
runWith :: Arrays a => PTX -> Acc a -> a

-- | Prepare and execute an embedded array program of one argument.
--   
--   This function can be used to improve performance in cases where the
--   array program is constant between invocations, because it enables us
--   to bypass front-end conversion stages and move directly to the
--   execution phase. If you have a computation applied repeatedly to
--   different input data, use this, specifying any changing aspects of the
--   computation via the input parameter. If the function is only evaluated
--   once, this is equivalent to <a>run</a>.
--   
--   To use <a>run1</a> effectively you must express your program as a
--   function of one argument. If your program takes more than one
--   argument, you can use <a>lift</a> and <a>unlift</a> to tuple up the
--   arguments.
--   
--   At an example, once your program is expressed as a function of one
--   argument, instead of the usual:
--   
--   <pre>
--   step :: Acc (Vector a) -&gt; Acc (Vector b)
--   step = ...
--   
--   simulate :: Vector a -&gt; Vector b
--   simulate xs = run $ step (use xs)
--   </pre>
--   
--   Instead write:
--   
--   <pre>
--   simulate xs = run1 step xs
--   </pre>
--   
--   You can use the debugging options to check whether this is working
--   successfully by, for example, observing no output from the
--   <tt>-ddump-cc</tt> flag at the second and subsequent invocations.
--   
--   See the programs in the 'accelerate-examples' package for examples.

data Async a :: * -> *

-- | Block the calling thread until the computation completes, then return

-- | Cancel a running asynchronous computation.
cancel :: Async a -> IO ()

-- | As <a>run</a>, but run the computation asynchronously and return
--   immediately without waiting for the result. The status of the
--   computation can be queried using <a>wait</a>, <a>poll</a>, and
--   <a>cancel</a>.
--   
--   Note that a CUDA context can be active on only one host thread at a
--   time. If you want to execute multiple computations in parallel, on the
--   same or different devices, use <a>runAsyncWith</a>.
runAsync :: Arrays a => Acc a -> IO (Async a)

-- | As <a>runWith</a>, but execute asynchronously. Be sure not to destroy

runAsyncWith :: Arrays a => PTX -> Acc a -> IO (Async a)

-- | As <a>run1</a>, but the computation is executed asynchronously.

-- | As <a>run1With</a>, but execute asynchronously.

-- | The PTX execution target for NVIDIA GPUs.

--   Note that since the amount of available pageable memory will be
